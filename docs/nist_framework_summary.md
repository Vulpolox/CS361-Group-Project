Summary
This document talks about the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and gives advice on how to use it in organizations and information systems. The RMF is a structured, disciplined, and flexible way to manage security and privacy risk. It includes categorizing information security; choosing, implementing, and evaluating controls; authorizing system and common controls; and keeping an eye on things all the time. The RMF has activities that get organizations ready to use the framework at the right level of risk management. The RMF also supports risk management in near real-time and ongoing authorization for information systems and common controls by putting in place continuous monitoring processes. It gives senior leaders and executives the information they need to make risk management decisions that are efficient and cost-effective for the systems that support their missions and business functions, and it builds security and privacy into the system development life cycle. When the RMF tasks are done, they connect important risk management processes at the system level to those at the organization level. It also makes sure that people are responsible for the controls that are put in place in an organization's IT systems and that those systems inherit.
