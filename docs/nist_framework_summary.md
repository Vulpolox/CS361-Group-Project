# NIST SP 800-37 Risk Management Framework (RMF):
## Link: https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/37/r2/final
## Summary:
This document talks about the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and gives advice on how to use it in organizations and information systems. The RMF is a structured, disciplined, and flexible way to manage security and privacy risk. It includes categorizing information security; choosing, implementing, and evaluating controls; authorizing system and common controls; and keeping an eye on things all the time. The RMF has activities that get organizations ready to use the framework at the right level of risk management. The RMF also supports risk management in near real-time and ongoing authorization for information systems and common controls by putting in place continuous monitoring processes. It gives senior leaders and executives the information they need to make risk management decisions that are efficient and cost-effective for the systems that support their missions and business functions, and it builds security and privacy into the system development life cycle. When the RMF tasks are done, they connect important risk management processes at the system level to those at the organization level. It also makes sure that people are responsible for the controls that are put in place in an organization's IT systems and that those systems inherit.
# NIST CSF
## Link: [The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf)
## Summary:
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides a high level voluntary guideline for cybersecurity practices that any organization would be able to implement notwithstanding its size, sector, or maturity.  The NIST CSF is composed of three components:
* **The CSF Core**
  * A set of cybersecurity outcomes divided into 6 main functions; these functions are further divided into categories
    * ***Govern (GV)***: Operates at a level higher than the other five functions; informs what an organization may do to realize the other functions
    * ***Identify (ID)***:  Understanding of the organization's current cybersecurity risks
    * ***Protect (PR)***:  Safeguards against the organization's current cybersecurity risks
    * ***Detect (DE)***:  Analysis and identification of cybersecurity attacks and compromises against the organization
    * ***Respond (RS)***:  Actions to be taken by the organization in the case of a cybersecurity incident
    * ***Recover (RC)***:  Assets affected by cybersecurity incident are recovered by the organization
* **CSF Organizational Profiles**
  * This describes the current and the goal states of an organization in terms of the CSF Core outcomes; the *current profile* describes the CSF Core outcomes the organization is currently achieving and the *target profile* describes the goal CSF Core outcomes that the organization wants to achieve
* **CSF Teirs**
  * These represent the level of rigor and sophistication of an organization's risk governance and risk management.  There are four tiers: Partial, Risk-Informed, Repeatable, Adaptive (lowest to highest complexity).
